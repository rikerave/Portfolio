            <h2>Description</h2>
            <a href="Creative breif .pdf"> Alo:Creative Brief</a>
            <p> This project was also for MKT 419 and actually goes along with the Social Media Audit. Again this project is focused on the brand I chose for the semester which was Alo. For this assingment, I had to come up with a creative breif. That means I had to type out a new idea for the brand to implement. This could be a new prodcut, new colorway, or anyhting that the brand does not yet have. The key here was to come up with something that will draw attention to them and that will reach their target audience and more. I had many ideas flowing but I knew I could only pick one. After a lot of back and forth I eventually came up with the "Alo Holiday Launch." Holiday launches are not uncommon for brands to do and Alo currently has yet to launch one, so I decided to create my own for them. I came up with new colorways and products and even a slogan to go along with the launch. "Celebrate the Holidays in style with Alo."</p>
                <p>Once I had my idea, I typed it all out in a Google Doc and presented it to my professor. </p>

                </ul>
            
         <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
                <p> The challenge I faced was coming up with a brand new idea that I felt was fitting for the brand. I took a lot of time and studied a lot of Alo's past collabprations, products, and launches. I wanted to be original but not too out fo the box that it was unrealisic for Alo to actually accomplish. I had a ton of ideas to begin with and narrowing it down was a big struggle but eventually I landed on the Alo Holiday Launch. </p>
