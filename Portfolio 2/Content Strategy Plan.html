            <h2>Description</h2>
            <a href="Content Strategy .pdf"> Content Strategy Plan</a>
            <p> This project was for my IMS 224 class. The idea behind this assingemnt was to pick an organization and focus solely on their use of digital branding. The organization I chose was a youth run non-profit, The Caleb white Project. This non-profit is based in Detroit, where I am from, and I actually worked with them for years before coming to college. Once I picked the prganization I wanted to focus on, I had to study their social medias and go through all their posts and look at what type of posts were most popular, what was their main platform, what are some things they should work on to increase attention. Once I found most my information, I input all my findings into a google sheets file so that I could clearly see the number of followers, likes, and comments across each of their platforms. After all the research was done, I was aksed to create mock social media posts that I feel would be beneficial to them. I used Canav to come up with and create these posts. Then I input all my information and facts into a neat Google slide project and presented it to my class. These slides hold all my discoveries and ideas to how the Caleb White Project should properly brand themselves. I am pelased as to hwo this turned out and I had a lot of fun coming up with mock posts. It defintly gave me good insight to the world of digital marketing and digital branding. </p>
            <h2> Resources Used</h2>

            <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
            <p> The challenging part of thsi assingment was coming up with ideas for the mock posts. Although they were a lot of fun to create, it was difficult coming up with new creative ideas for the organization. It took a lot of time and energy to find all the information I needed to make the presentation. it took a long time to go through all their accoutns and look at likes, shares, comments, ect. In the end, hard work paid off and I was able to successfully complete this project. </p>
