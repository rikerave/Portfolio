            <h2>Description</h2>
            <a href="Client Presentation .pdf"> Alo: Client Presntation</a>
            <p> This is the third and final step to my last two previous projects. Again it was for my MKT 419 class and is based around the brand Alo. I had to take what I came up with in the creative breif and put it into a presenation and simulate what it would be like to pitch it Alo themselves. I created a lengthy powerpoint to present to my professor. It had about 16 slides and consisted of the holiday Launch idea and decriptions and visuals of all the products and colors I created. I made sure to make the presenation professional yet fun so I decided to choose a festive background for my slides to go along with the Holiday theme. I am very proud of how this project turned out and looking at all three parts, it shows how much effort I put into my work and how dedicated I am to making it look serious and professional. </p>


            <h2> Resources Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Creative Brief Doc</li>
                <li>Google slides</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Screenshots or Demos</h2>
            <p> Here are a few screen shots of the slides. The link to the slides are up at the top so that you can view the whole presnetation.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
            <p> The most challenging part of this assingment for me was coming up with facts to put on the slides about the Alo and their sales. Not only did I have to present my idea and show visuals of what I want the launch to look like, I also needed to present that sales aspect of it. Doing research of Alo's past ijncrease of sales was a bit difficult just beacsue there wasn't a ton of information on it. Ovrall, I liked how it turned out and I felt like I had enough information to make it sound accurate and professional. </p>
