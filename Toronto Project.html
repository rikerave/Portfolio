            <h2>Description</h2>
            <a href="Tornoto Logo-1.pdf"> Logos for Toronto</a>
            <a href="Tornto Deliverables (mock ups)-1.pdf"> Deliverable mock ups for the logos</a>
            <p> This project was for my IMS 254 class. This class was all about building logos and Adobe Illustrator. For this specific assignment I had to pick a city (I picked Toronto) and come up with six logos and descriptions for all of them and then picking three of the final logos and put them on a t-shirt, buisness card, and bilboard. I created all the logos in Illustator and added different colors and elements to each of them to highlight different attributes of Toronto. I was really pleased with how my logos turned out. Using Illustrator isn't always easy especially when your free drawing with the pen tool and vectorizing images. This project defintialy gave me a better understading of not only Illustrator but also how complex logos really are. There is so much work put into them and so many aspects to consider. All the way down to color and design, there is a meaning for every detial of logos. </p>

            <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
            <p> The most challenging part of this assingment for me was coming up with facts to put on the slides about the Alo and their sales. Not only did I have to present my idea and show visuals of what I want the launch to look like, I also needed to present that sales aspect of it. Doing research of Alo's past ijncrease of sales was a bit difficult just beacsue there wasn't a ton of information on it. Ovrall, I liked how it turned out and I felt like I had enough information to make it sound accurate and professional. </p>
